       "In 2021, both Uber and Lyft had significant cash and investment holdings as major assets, reflecting their need for liquidity to fund operations. However, Uber's cash and investments were substantially larger at $16.1 billion compared to Lyft's $3.3 billion, indicating Uber's greater financial resources.\n",
       "\n",
       "A key difference was Uber's much higher goodwill and intangible assets of $10.8 billion versus Lyft's $180.5 million, likely due to Uber's larger acquisition activities over the years. Uber also had higher property and equipment assets of $1.9 billion compared to Lyft's $298.2 million, suggesting a more extensive physical operational footprint.\n",

       "On the liabilities side, both companies had substantial accrued liabilities, insurance reserves, and lease obligations. However, Uber's long-term debt of $9.3 billion dwarfed Lyft's $655.2 million, reflecting Uber's higher leverage and borrowing needs.\n",

       "Overall, while both companies had similar liability components, Uber's assets were significantly larger across multiple categories, highlighting its greater scale, acquisitions, and capital-intensive nature compared to Lyft's relatively smaller operations and asset base.\n"

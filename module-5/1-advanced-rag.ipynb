       "In terms of major assets in 2021, both Uber and Lyft had significant cash and investment holdings, with Uber's cash and investments totaling around $16.1 billion, while Lyft's cash, cash equivalents, and investments amounted to around $3.3 billion. However, Uber had substantially higher goodwill and intangible assets of $10.8 billion, likely from its larger acquisition activity, compared to Lyft's goodwill of $180.5 million. Uber also had higher property and equipment assets of $1.9 billion versus Lyft's $298.2 million.\n",

       "Regarding major liabilities, both companies had substantial accrued liabilities, with Uber's accrued and other current liabilities at $6.5 billion and Lyft's at $1.2 billion. Uber had a significantly higher long-term debt balance of $9.3 billion compared to Lyft's $655 million. Additionally, Uber had long-term insurance reserves of $2.5 billion, while Lyft's insurance reserves were $1.1 billion. Lyft's operating lease liabilities of $264 million were lower than Uber's $1.8 billion.\n",

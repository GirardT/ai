# Module 1 - Fundamentals

Although this is a Generative AI course, we will need some basic skills to get started.

## Software Development Fundamentals
- This course will mainly use **Python** for all the tasks that require coding. 
- As with any software development project, **version control** is essential. We will be using **Git** for this purpose.
- This study group is a collaborative effort and we hope that you will collaborate and work together on the included projects. To make it easier, please use the group's **Discord channel** , **Github** to share your work, and **LinkedIn** to share you learnings.
- The final project will be an **end-to-end Generative AI solution** and will require some web work. There are tech stack options available to you depending on your dev background.
- And finally in any software development work, **having soft skills** are equally as important as the technical skill. Things like communication, teamwork and time management are crucial soft skills in software development.   

## Jupyter Notebooks

We recommend that everyone taking this course uses **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** with the following list of useful extensions:

- [Jupyter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter)
- [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)
- [Pylance](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance)


## Preparing your Python environment

We recommend that you use [Pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to manage your Python versions. This will allow you to easily switch between different versions of Python and also manage your virtual environments.

And before starting any Python development, it is best practice to create a **virtual environment**. This will allow you to isolate your project dependencies from your system dependencies.

Typically this can be done like so:

```bash
pyenv versions
pyenv install 3.12.2
pyenv local 3.12.2
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

## Assignment
- Install **Visual Studio Code** with the extensions listed above
- Install **Pyenv**, **create and activate a virtual environment** for Python 3.12
- **Fork** this course in your personal Github 
- **Star** this course in Github
- Join the **[Discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/1041795715757789204/1094455854897573908)** and introduce yourself
- Let others know what you are learning now and **LinkedIn** is great for this
- Connect with your study group members on **LinkedIn**, and [with me too](https://linkedin.com/in/joreyes)!

      "* In number theory, 42 is often referred to as \"the answer\" due to its appearance in Douglas Adams' science fiction series \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.\" The book describes 42 as the \"Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything.\"\n",
      "* 42 is also a abundant number, meaning that the sum of its proper divisors (excluding the number itself) adds up to more than the number.\n",
      "* In geometry, 42 is a significant number in the study of polyhedra, as it's the number of edges on a dodecahedron.\n",
      "\n",
      "In science:\n",
      "\n",
      "* The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN was initially designed to collide protons at an energy of 1.18 trillion electronvolts (TeV), but due to technical difficulties, the collisions began at 3.5 TeV, which is approximately equal to 42 GeV.\n",
      "* In astronomy, the Hubble Space Telescope has observed a galaxy named UDFj-42056583, also known as GN-z11, which is estimated to be around 13.4 billion light-years away from Earth â€“ making it the most distant object ever observed, with a redshift of approximately 42.\n",
